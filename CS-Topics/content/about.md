Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! 👋  

I’m a **Computer Science student** in the Department of Computer Science at **University of Bari Aldo Moro**. My passion for technology is boundless, especially when it involves anything programmable. From writing simple scripts to tackling complex systems, I find joy in turning ideas into working code.

## What Drives Me 🚀

I have a particular interest in **concurrent systems**. Understanding how processes interact, synchronize, and scale fascinates me, and I aim to dive deeper into these aspects through this blog. I believe sharing insights and learning publicly is one of the best ways to grow and refine one's knowledge.

Here, you’ll find thoughts, experiments, and explorations into:

- **Parallel and concurrent programming**
- System design principles  
- Programming paradigms and best practices

## My Toolbelt 🛠️

I enjoy programming in multiple languages, each offering its own strengths and philosophies. Here’s what I currently work with:

- **C**, **C++**: For performance and systems programming  
- **Java**, **Kotlin**: When robust, platform-independent applications are the goal  
- **Rust**: Because memory safety and concurrency can coexist beautifully  
- **Python**: For scripting, data analysis, and automation  
- **Go**: When simplicity and speed meet concurrency  

I am always eager to learn new tools and technologies that expand my horizons.

## My Philosophy: Free and Open 🌍

I’m a strong believer in **Free Software** and a proud user of **Linux**. Open-source communities inspire me, and I try to contribute whenever possible. I believe that software should empower users, not limit them.
