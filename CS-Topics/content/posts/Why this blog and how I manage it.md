Hello everyone! My name is Costantino. I’m a computer science student and a tech enthusiast. The main purpose of this blog is to explore and share insights on some of the most exciting topics in the fascinating world of computer science.

Let me start by explaining how I write and manage this blog.

I primarily take notes in Obsidian, though I’m currently evaluating Emacs’ Org mode as a possible alternative. For the blog itself, I decided to use Markdown for content creation and Hugo as a powerful static site generator. Hugo not only offers a modern UI but also provides handy scripts that make the update process straightforward and efficient.

### Starting point - Obsidian

If you’re not familiar with Obsidian yet, check it out at [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). You’ll discover how incredibly powerful and versatile it is!

Once you’ve downloaded and installed it on your PC, you’ll be ready to create amazing notes about whatever interests you the most.

#### My main setup

I’ve created a directory called “Blog,” which contains a subdirectory named “posts” (yes, as you’ve probably guessed, it holds all the posts for this blog). This structure keeps my content neatly organized.


Once you’ve written your first note, it’s time to set up Hugo and dive into some other cool tools.
